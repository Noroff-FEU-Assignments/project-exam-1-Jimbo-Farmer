            <h2>Sometimes the future can seem pretty bleak.</h2>
            <p>We’re currently in the earth’s sixth mass-extinction event, with the world’s wildlife population down 68% since 1970. <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/worlds-wildlife-populations-fell-68-since-1970-wwf/a-54874308">(Read More)</a></p>    
            <p>Current projections place global heating at 3 degrees above pre-industrial levels by 2100. <a href="https://climateactiontracker.org/global/temperatures/"> (Read More)</a> This amount of heating means drowned cities, agricultural failure, water insecurity and large reductions in the human population.</p>
            <p>Even without the biodiversity of climate crises, we live in a world that currently produces enough for everyone to have a good standard of living, and yet millions go to bed hungry each night (assuming they have a bed in the first place). We’ve built weapons capable of destroying ourselves many times over and have divided and conquered ourselves  again and again. </p>
            <h2>We can do better</h2>
            <p>Human beings are arguably the most empathic creatures the world has ever known, capable of helping complete strangers and non-human beings, sometimes through acts of great personal sacrifice. </p>
            <p>That which unites us will always be far greater than any perceived differences. We share the same basic needs for nourishment, security and community. </p>
            <h2>The solutions exist</h2>
            <p>The solutions to the problems we face already exist, and most have been tried and tested in one form or another. Some of the solutions are personal and require change at the individual level, while others require us to come together in our communities and even in networks of communities in order to create the positive changes that we are capable of. </p>
            <p>It is the goal of Transform Tomorrow to outline some of these solutions and to inspire hope and optimism among visitors to the site.</p>
